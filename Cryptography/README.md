# Cryptography 

This folder contains information about the encryption methods used in the WiFi Connection Simulation. Cryptography plays a key role in securing the connection between the client and the server by encrypting authentication challenges and transmitted data.

## Introduction

Cryptography ensures that communication between devices is private and secure. In real WiFi networks, encryption is used to:

- Authenticate devices trying to connect.
- Protect data from being intercepted or altered during transmission.

This folder focuses on the encryption techniques used in the simulation and provides a foundation for understanding how cryptography works in networking.

## Encryption in the Simulation

The simulation demonstrates how encryption is used in two main steps:

1. **Authentication**:
    - The server sends a unique challenge to the client.
    - The client encrypts the challenge using the password and sends it back.
    - The server validates the response by encrypting the challenge itself and comparing results.

2. **Data Transmission**:
    - After authentication, data sent between the client and server is encrypted using the RC4 stream cipher.

These steps replicate how encryption protocols like WEP work, even though WEP is now outdated and vulnerable in real-world applications.

## Current Implementation: WEP and RC4

- **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)**:
    - A legacy encryption protocol used in older WiFi networks.
    - Vulnerable to attacks due to weak key management and outdated algorithms.
    - In this simulation, WEP is used for simplicity and educational purposes.

- **RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4)**:
    - A stream cipher used in WEP for encrypting data.
    - It generates a pseudorandom stream of bytes (keystream) that is XORed with the data to produce encrypted output.
    - While easy to implement, RC4 is not secure for modern use due to known vulnerabilities.

For a deeper explanation, refer to the [WEP](WEP/README.md) and [RC4](WEP/RC4.md) documentation files in this folder.

## Future Enhancements

While this simulation currently uses WEP and RC4 for simplicity, stronger encryption protocols like WPA2 and WPA3 are recommended in real-world networks. The modular design of this project allows for future updates to include these modern protocols.
