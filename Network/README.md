## Establish a Connection
- The device and router exchange packets to establish a stable connection.
- The router confirms access, and your device joins the network.
## Security Handshake
- For secured networks, encryption protocols (like WPA2 or WPA3) initiate a handshake to establish a secure connection.
- Data sent between your device and the router is encrypted to prevent eavesdropping.
## Information Communication 
- The device verifies the connection by sending test packets to the internet (e.g., pinging a server).
- If successful, the device declares the connection active and ready for internet or local network use.
